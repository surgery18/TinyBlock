TinyBlock is a decentralized URL shortener built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It leverages the power and transparency of blockchain technology to provide users with a robust and transparent URL shortening service.

## Features

- **Decentralized**: Unlike traditional URL shorteners, TinyBlock does not rely on a centralized server or database. All URLs are stored on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring transparency and permanence.
- **Wallet Integration**: Users connect with their BSC-compatible wallets to shorten URLs and view their history.

- **Transparent**: Every shortened URL is associated with a wallet address, and users can only see URLs they've shortened.

- **Gas-Efficient**: TinyBlock's smart contract is optimized for minimal gas usage, making it cost-effective for users.

## Why Choose TinyBlock?

- **Security**: As a decentralized application, TinyBlock is more resilient to common web attacks compared to traditional web applications.
- **Transparency**: Every action is recorded on the blockchain, providing a clear and immutable history of all shortened URLs.

- **Cost-Efficient**: With our optimized smart contract, the cost to shorten a URL is minimal.

- **User-Centric**: Only the user can see their shortened URLs, ensuring privacy and control.
